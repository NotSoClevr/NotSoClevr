# About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS.
- 📆 Once I finish some of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum and get used to programming, I will start Harvards cs50x course on edx.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning coding using free resources.
- 🖥 The programming languages I want to learn are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C, C++, C#, Python, and SQL.
- 🧑‍💻 The career I am aiming for is a full-stack developer, though I will be happy in either a front or back end roll.
